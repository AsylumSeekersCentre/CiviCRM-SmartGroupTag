CiviCRM-SmartGroupTag
=====================

CiviCRM Extension providing automatic tagging based on Smart Groups.

This extension reads from the map.txt file to associate Tags with Smart Groups.
All listed tags are deleted, and then added again to the Contacts in the associated Smart Groups.

At present, it expects one tag to apply to only one group. This limitation should be fixed in future versions.

Multiple tags can be applied to the same group.
